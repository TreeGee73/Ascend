## Description
Choose a character and duel your way through various creatures and bosses to the top of the tower.

## User Story
I want to kill some time killing random creatures in an attempt to reach the final boss (top of the tower). I want to be able to enter my player name, select a character or have a character selected for me, and then battle random opponents for virtual cash and prizes.

Intended for use by anyone who wants to play a simple web based video game.

## APIs to be Used
To start we will be building our own, but are also looking to possibly utilize external APIs for characters, creatures, and/or items should time allow. External APIs, if used, are yet to be decided.
